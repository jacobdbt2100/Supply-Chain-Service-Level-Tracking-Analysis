# Supply Chain Service Level Tracking Analysis
___

## Executive Summary:
I analysed supply chain service level data and found that On-Time and In-Full service levels were consistentlt less than targets with at least 23% difference over a period of six months. "Delivered" quantity fall short of "Orders" by 400,000. Three customers out of the top 5 having over one million order quantity were conspicuously underserved with On_Time delivery as down to 28%. Other customers had less than 800,000 order quantity.

Base on these findings, I recommend targeted product manufacturing schedules and real-time inventory tracking to boost operational efficiency.

## Business Problem:
For supply chain–driven organisations, service level performance directly affects customer satisfaction, retention, and contractual compliance. In this organisation, management observed recurring complaints from customers and inconsistent service level outcomes but lacked clear visibility into where and why performance was falling short. The objective was to analyse supply chain service level data by tracking On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and On-Time-In-Full (OTIF) deliveries against agreed targets, alongside Line Fill Rate and Volume Fill Rate across multiple customers. This analysis aimed to identify key gaps in service performance, highlight customers or order types most impacted, and provide actionable insights to improve delivery reliability and overall service levels.
