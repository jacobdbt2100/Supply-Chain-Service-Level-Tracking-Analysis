# Supply Chain Service Level Tracking Analysis
___

## Executive Summary:
I analysed supply chain service level data and found that On-Time and In-Full service levels were consistentlt less than targets with at least 23% difference over a period of six months. "Delivered" quantity fall short of "Orders" by 400,000. Three customers out of the top 5 having over one million order quantity were conspicuously underserved with On_Time delivery as down to 28%. Other customers had less than 800,000 order quantity.

Base on these findings, I recommend targeted product manufacturing schedules and real-time inventory tracking to boost operational efficiency.
